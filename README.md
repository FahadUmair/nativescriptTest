# nativescriptTest
So, this app has a couple of items in it and a few different pages. You need to set up the android emulator on your device to test the app or you can download the nativescript playground app.
However, the most important thing which we needed to test (firebase) is not working. 
Open the app.component.ts file where you could see I have commented out the firebase inititalization. Whenever I try to initialize it, the app stops working.
